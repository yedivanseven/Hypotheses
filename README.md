# Hypotheses
## Exercises in statistical hypothesis testing

You are the owner of a web-store and you just ran an AB-test on the design
(well, actually, an ABC-test because there were three different designs). Now
that the data is in, it's time to see what you can learn. Better make sure, though,
to draw the right conclusions or the right reasons.

## Implements
Even if you're not much into AB-testing (yawn), you might be interested in
*Welch ANOVA* and the corresponding *Games-Howell* post-hoc test in the
`IPython` notebook. I have not found any other `python` implementation of these
tests. Hopefully, they will make thier way into `scipy.stats` someday ...

## Dependencies
Everything seems to run smoothly on a fairly fresh Anaconda 4.3 install.
This is for `python 3.6`.
